        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            As a child psychiatrist, I delve into the intricacies of mental well-being, nurturing the human psyche.
            My passions span across modern jazz harmonies and the profound realms of philosophy.
            The world of coding and the fine arts are my latest playgrounds of exploration.
            Language, a fascinating tapestry, is woven into my life through the art of cooking, the rhythm of drumming,
            and the cadence of poetry.
            I maintain vitality through tennis and reminisce about my long-distance swimming days
            in the contemplative confines of libraries.
